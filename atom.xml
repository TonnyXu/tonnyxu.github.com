    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Knowing Octopress for a long time</h2>

<p>I still remember the first time I saw a blog which is build on
Octopress, I was so impressed that this blog system is neat and great
for programmers. But it was built on Ruby, I just gave a thought and did
not continue to setup one for myself. Until today, I tried hard to
overcome a lot of wiered Ruby problem, and it is online now.</p>

<h2>Reason for choosing Octopress</h2>

<p>There are many other guys wrote a lot of wonderful posts on this topics.
See
<a href="http://oblita.com/blog/2012/07/06/octopress-with-mathjax-by-kramdown/">Chico</a>
for his reason and tutorial. Especially when you want to use beautiful math
expressions, read this. Other posts like
<a href="http://akkunchoi.github.com/jekyll-github-blogging.html">akkunchoi</a> who
built his blog system on Jekyll which is the base system of Octopress.
Another guy <a href="http://blueplanet.github.com/blog/page/8/">BluePlanet</a> moved from Jekyll to Octopress. <a href="http://change-the-world.github.com/blog/2012/08/26/1/">Shun Matsumoto</a> also wrote a post in Japanese. If you&rsquo;d like to read Japanese, it&rsquo;s a good post.</p>

<p>For me, the reason is simple.</p>

<ol>
<li>Octopress support git to manage the history of posts</li>
<li>Octopress can be easily deployed to github, FREE</li>
<li>Octopress support using markdown to write my posts, which is much
more fun than HTML or any other markup language</li>
</ol>


<h2>What&rsquo;s next?</h2>

<p>Just keep on updating my blogs and bring you high quality posts on
iOS/Mac/Web/HTML5 relates fields.</p>

<p>Bon Voyage!</p>
